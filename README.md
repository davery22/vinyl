# Vinyl: Relational Record Streams

Inspired by SQL, built for Java. Vinyl takes the expressive power of SQL queries and reimagines it on top of Java
Streams. Through carefully designed abstractions, relational operations prioritize safety without compromising
terseness. Seamless integration with Java Streams achieves efficiency and parallelism, while enabling new extremes of
flexibility.
