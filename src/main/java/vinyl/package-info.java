/**
 * Vinyl is a library for streaming relational records.
 *
 * <p>Vinyl offers SQL-inspired operations on its "record-streams"
 *
 * <p>The design of Vinyl is influenced primarily by a strong desire to achieve <b>mechanical sympathy</b> with the
 * "Java way". It is inspired by continuous study of OpenJDK implementation patterns, interfaces, and intent.
